#  Vacation-Villas
Welcome to our villa rental! We provide a relaxing place for families and friends. Our villa has comfortable rooms, beautiful views, and all the amenities you need for a great stay. Whether you want to explore or just relax, we are here to make your vacation special!

As summer is just around the corner, people are starting to book. I need your help in keeping all the information clear and accessible. This will not only save time and reduce errors (like double bookings) but also enhance the guest experience.

I need to know about the villas I am renting out: the address, room count, does it have a backyard or a pool (must have only 1), is it currently available, the name of the renter, rented from [start date] to [end date], how much I charge per night, and which crew is in charge of that villa.

I also need to know the condition of each villa. Fill in just the number. It can be either:
1.	Needs maintenance
2.	Needs cleaning
3.	Needs restocking of supplies
4.	Ready for guests!
5.	Rented out

## Questions:
Q: When did you start this business?
A: We started advertising in May, but bookings only started on the twenty-third of June 2025.
Q: Can more than one crew maintain a villa?
A: No.
Q: Can a crew maintain more than one villa?
A: Yes.
Q: What is the most you ever rented a villa for?
A: The largest villa is usually rented for $2,500 a night.
Q: Do you ever schedule a booking when the condition of the villa is 1, 2, or 3?
A: No, a villa is only considered available when it is clean and well-maintained.
Q: How many rooms does your largest villa have?
A: Including its 10 bedrooms, it has 15 rooms.


## Reports:
1)	How many villas am I currently in charge of?
2)	How many villas are rented now, and how many are not (for whatever reason)?
3)	What is the average, minimum, and maximum rental duration?
4)	What is the condition of each villa written out in words?
